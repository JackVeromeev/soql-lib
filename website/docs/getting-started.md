# Getting started

Apex QS provides functional constructs for SOQL.

## Examples

```apex
//SELECT Id FROM Account
List<Account> accounts = (List<Account>) QS.of(Account.sObjectType).asList();
```

```apex
//SELECT Id, Name, Industry, Country FROM Account
List<Account> accounts = (List<Account>) QS.of(Account.sObjectType)
   .fields(new List<sObjectField>{
      Account.Id, Account.Name, Account.Industry, Account.Country
   })
   .asList();
```

## Assumptions

1. **Small Selector Classes** - Selector class should be small and contains ONLY query base configuration (fields, sharing settings) and very generic methods (`getById`, `getByRecordType`). Why?
   - Huge classes are hard to manage.
   - A lot of merge conflicts.
   - Problems with methods naming.
2. **Build SOQL inline in a place of need** - Business specific SOQLs should be build inline via `QS` builder in a place of need.
   - Most of the queries on the project are case specific and are not generic. There is no need to keep them in Selector class.
3. **Build SOQL dynamically via builder** - Developer should be able to adjust query with specific fields, conditions, and other SOQL clauses.
4. **Do not spend time on selector methods naming** - It can be difficult to find a proper name for method that builds a query. Selector class contains methods like `selectByFieldAAndFieldBWithDescOrder`. It can be avoided by building SOQL inline in a place of need.
5. **Controll FLS ans sharing settings** - Selector should allow to control Field Level Security and sharing settings by the simple methods like `.systemMode()`, `.withSharing()`, `.withoutSharing()`.
6. **Auto binding** - Selector should be able to bind variables dynamically without additional effort from developer side.
7. **Mock results in Unit Tests** - Selector should allow for mocking data in unit tests.
